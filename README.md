# 🧮 Carbon Credit Calculator
A simple tool to estimate carbon credits based on carbon dioxide emissions. This calculator helps individuals and organizations quantify their environmental impact and understand how many carbon credits are needed to offset it.

## 🌍 Purpose
The Carbon Credit Calculator is designed to:
- Estimate the CO₂ emissions from user input.
- Calculate the equivalent number of carbon credits needed.
- Support broader initiatives in sustainability and carbon offsetting.

## 🔧 Features
- 📥 Takes CO₂ emissions as input.
- 🧮 Calculates carbon credits using standard formulas.
- 🖥️ Simple, user-friendly interface for ease of access.
- 🌐 Ready for integration with blockchain-based platforms or environmental dashboards.

## 📌 How It Works
1. User inputs the amount of CO₂ emitted (in kg or tonnes).
2. The calculator applies a defined formula or conversion factor.
3. The result shows the number of carbon credits required to offset the emissions.

## 🏗️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Logic:** Basic CO₂-to-credit conversion algorithm (can be extended)
- **Optional Integration:** Ready for use with blockchain smart contracts or backend services.

## 💡 Formula Used
> 1 carbon credit = 1 tonne of CO₂ reduced or offset
