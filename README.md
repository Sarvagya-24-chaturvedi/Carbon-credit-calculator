# 🧮 Carbon Emission Calculator
A simple and efficient tool to estimate carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions based on user inputs such as electricity usage, fuel consumption, travel distance, and other activities. Designed to raise environmental awareness and promote sustainable choices.

## 🌍 Purpose
The Carbon Emission Calculator is designed to:
- Estimate the CO₂ emissions from user input.
- Calculate the equivalent number of carbon credits needed.
- Support broader initiatives in sustainability and carbon offsetting.

## 🔧 Features
- 📥 Takes CO₂ emissions as input.
- 🧮 Calculates carbon emissions using standard formulas.
- 🖥️ Simple, user-friendly interface for ease of access.
- 🌐 Ready for integration with blockchain-based platforms or environmental dashboards.

## 📌 How It Works
1. User inputs the amount of CO₂ emitted (in kg or tonnes).
2. Click Calculate to view estimated CO₂ emissions.
3. Get insights on your carbon footprint and possible reduction measures.

## 🏗️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Logic:** Basic CO₂-to-credit conversion algorithm (can be extended)
- **Optional Integration:** Ready for use with blockchain smart contracts or backend services.

## 💡 Formula Used
> 1 carbon credit = 1 tonne of CO₂ reduced or offset
